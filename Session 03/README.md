## FAQ

### Which is the meaning of MySQL Workbench flags? 

When creating attributes with MSQL Workbench we can use different flags:

  - PK: Primary Key
  - NN: Not Null
  - BIN: Binary (stores data as binary strings. There is no character set so sorting and comparison is based on the numeric values of the bytes in the values.)
  - UN: Unsigned (non-negative numbers only. so if the range is -500 to 500, instead its 0 - 1000, the range is the same but it starts at 0)
  - UQ: Create/remove Unique Key
  - ZF: Zero-Filled (if the length is 5 like INT(5) then every field is filled with 0â€™s to the 5th value. 12 = 00012, 400 = 00400, etc. )
  - AI: Auto Increment
  - G: Generated column. i.e. value generated by a formula based on the other columns.

### How can I connect to MySQL using the terminal?

If MySQL is installed in your OS, open the terminal and execute this instruction:

 - For Windows (move to the folder where MySQL is installed): 

```
mysql -u root -p
```

 - For MAC: 
 
```
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -uroot -p
```

### Once I'm connected to MySQL using the terminal, how can I discover and use the databases and tables?

Just execute the following SQL Instructions:

 - Retrieve the databases

```
show databases;
```

 - Use a particular database (substitute <database_name> for one of the databases in your server)

```
use <database_name>;
```

 - Use a particular table (substitute <table_name> for one of the tables in your server)

```
use <table_name>;
```
